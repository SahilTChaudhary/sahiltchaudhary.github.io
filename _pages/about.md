Welcome to my website!

Here is my [Resume](http://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)!

I am Sahil Chaudhary, a **Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh**. My specialization lies in the vast and exciting field of **Robotics**. In particular, I am interested in all things at the intersection of **Autonomous Decision-Making, Planning and Control**, particularly for autonomous systems and field robotics. I invite you to explore my work and experiences that have shaped and defined my passion for the field.

<h2>My Skillset</h2>
  * <b>Programming Languages:</b> C++, Python, MATLAB, Julia
  * <b>Tools and Software:</b> Gazebo, Isaac Lab, Matplotlib, PyTorch, NumPy, SKLearn, SolidWorks, Ansys, Fusion 360
  * <b>Platforms:</b> ROS, Git, Linux, Docker
  * <b>Knowledge Areas:</b> Controls, Planning, SLAM, Robot Dynamics, Machine Learning, CAD, Mechanical Design, Rapid Prototyping 

<h2>My Work and Projects</h2>

* As a **Graduate Research Assistant in the Biorobotics Lab at CMU**, I am working on developing algorithms and features for **Multi-Agent Planning and Controls for a heterogenous system of robots, along with Comms-Aware Planning**.

  *	Spearheaded the development of a **MANET framework** using DDS and ROS to **ensure communication fidelity in heterogeneous robot convoys**, implement network topology repair and recovery behaviors, and enforce a communication boundary.
  *	**Comms-Aware Planning:** Designed a novel algorithm attaining **99% success rate** to maintain communication fidelity over radio among robots in convoy, by formulating a **modified Max-Min Spanning Tree**, and validated the algorithm through extensive hardware testing.
  *	**Heterogeneous Convoy Framework:** Developed a **decentralized convoy framework** integrating RC cars and quadrupeds like Boston Dynamicsâ€™ Spot, and an algorithm enabling rendezvous at intersections and coordinated return as a convoy, as part of exploratory features.
  *	Enhanced the operational efficiency of the **Local Planner by up to 29%**, through **waypoint optimization and trajectory smoothing**, reducing unnecessary deceleration between waypoints and improving overall robot speed and motion continuity.
  *	**Payload Redesign:** Engineered a **modular, serviceable payload** for RC cars and quadruped robots, accomplishing a **7% weight reduction** and lowering the center of gravity while ensuring optimal sensor field-of-view and accessibility, and incorporating sensors such as LiDAR, IMU, cameras, onboard computer, motor controller, and circuit boards.

* My prior work and professional experiences include:

  * Worked as a **Course Assistant for the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Engineers (24787) course in Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering**, in which I assisted Professor L. Burak Kara in teaching core concepts to graduate students.
  * Worked at **ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS) India Limited, as a Graduate Engineer Trainee**.

* My coursework and projects cover a wide variety of domains, contributing to my development as a holistic Robotics Engineer. Here are some of the domains in which my knowledge and expertise lies:

  * <b>Controls:</b> [PID, LQR, MPC](https://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/portfolio/5_cmuBuggy/), and [MPPI](https://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/portfolio/3_mppi_/) controllers, and have also worked on non-linear traj-opt methods like iLQR.
  * <b>Planning:</b> A* and its variants, [D* Lite, PRM](https://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/portfolio/1_planning/), RRT and its variants, and have hence developed a keen understanding of these algorithms.
Other domains include:
  * <b>SLAM:</b> State estimation methods like [EKF, and LiDAR-IMU time syncing](https://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/portfolio/4_pointLIO/).
  * <b>Machine Learning:</b> Traditional supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, and implementation using PyTorch and SKLearn libraries.
  * <b>Reinforcement Learning:</b> Value-Based and Policy-Based RL algorithms, and deployment of a [PPO-agent to play a game of Pinball!](https://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/portfolio/2_pinbot/)
  * <b>Hardware:</b> Worked on several hardware projects over the ears, including designing payloads for robots. I am a MechE afterall!

Thank you for taking the time to go through my portfolio. I look forward to any opportunities that come my way!
